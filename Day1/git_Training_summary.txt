1. Learnt about ssh key creation.
2. then linking our local directory to a repo using remote add origin
3. then staging our code
4. pushing it upstream
5. creating a branch locally and making changes in it.
6. switching back to main and merging the branch into main.
7. Then pushing the code... after code we pushed the branch as well.
8. Now we created 2 branches, made changes in both.
9. we tried merging first branch to main, it worked.
10. but now when we tried merging the second one then it caused merge conflict as both the branches had changes in the same line.
11. we solved the merge conflict and pushed the code as well as branch.

DONE...
